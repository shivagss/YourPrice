**What problem does this app address:**

* Casual sellers do not have a simple way of quickly putting items for sale today. Posting on Craigslist is cumbersome and items not sold within a few weeks it expire, requiring to repost items often.
* There is no adequate mobile buying experience for local buyers which encourage browsing without the need of knowing what you are looking for. With Craigslist the buying experience is dry and boring and it does not fit well the mobile form factor even for Craigslist mobile apps in the market today.


**How does this app solve that problem:**

InstaSell solves this problem by creating a mobile marketplace in which posting items is super simple and the buying experience leverages the browsing patterns from successful social apps.

**Requirements Checklist:**

Must have **at least** three separate "activities" or screens supporting user interaction

* The project has a total of 6 separate acitvities.

Must use a **RESTful API** to source the data that is populated into the application

* While Parse precludes the need of interacting with a backend using RESTful API, it allows creating REST endpoints with 
“Cloud Code”. Specific functionality like comment feeds can be implemented using RESTful apis serviced by Parse. 
* In addition we can use AWS S3’s REST api for storing BLOBS in the cloud.

Must use **local persistence** either through files, preferences or SQLite

* All data will be persisted in SQLite for offline viewing.
