**App Name: YouBid**

**What problem does this app address:**

* Local sellers (neighbors selling used items or local shops) and service providers do not have a marketplace where they can offer their items or services without specifying a fix price. The seller might not have a price in mind or such price may fluctuate based on demand or availability. When setting a price the seller usually needs to compromise between his desired price and his lowest one. When setting a too high price then potential customers are missed. 

* Buyers do not have a fun and dynamic mobile application that allows them to browse for local deals on the go and make offers for items or services. Moreover today there is no way for a buyer to offer items they own for exchange.

**How does this app solve that problem:**

YouBid creates a new marketplace in which items for sale or services do not have associated sale prices but instead buyers make offers to sellers to acquire the items.

This structure lowers the seller friction by making posting an item for sale super simple. This encourages sellers to post many items which today do not have a marketplace. Such items are unlikely to be posted to Craigslist because it takes effort, it is not clear what price is fair and the items expire after a couple of weeks.

YouBid also lowers the friction for the buyer which feels more control and can offer anything they feel or are able to for the item. The buyer is able to comment and ask questions in an item feed which leverages the patters of successful social app.

The seller is able to specify to the system a minimum price below which the offer would be automatically rejected. A variable delay ranging from minutes to hours may be introduced to the automatic rejection to keep buyers from probing or annoying the seller.


**App Audience:**

* Local sellers with a mobile phone for posting items or services for sale.
* Local buyers looking for a specific item or just interested in searching for deals in the neighborhood or just curious of what neighbors or friends are selling.

## Section C.

**Checklist of screens needed:**

* Splash (optional)
* Registration screen
* Login screen
* Post Item for Sale screen
* Item Feed screen
* Comment screen
* Store screen


**Requirements Checklist:**

Must have **at least** three separate "activities" or screens supporting user interaction

* The project has a total of 6 separate acitvities.

Must be **data-driven** with dynamic information or media being displayed

* All user, inventory and user comments is data driven with dynamic information stored in the cloud. We will use Parse as the primary backend technology for the project.

Must use a **RESTful API** to source the data that is populated into the application

* While Parse precludes the need of interacting with a backend using RESTful API, it allows creating REST endpoints with 
“Cloud Code”. Specific functionality like comment feeds can be implemented using RESTful apis serviced by Parse. 
* In addition we can use AWS S3’s REST api for storing BLOBS in the cloud.

Must use **local persistence** either through files, preferences or SQLite

* All data will be persisted in SQLite for offline viewing.
